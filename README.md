# DynamicDesktopRepo

A repository of all Dynamic Desktop Wallpapers that I've come across.

If you want to add your own, reach out to me.

If you want to make your own, follow the guide on the original project's repo
https://github.com/t1m0thyj/WinDynamicDesktop/wiki/Creating-custom-themes
ALSO: If you have a zip file that you can successfully import, rename the file and change the extension from .zip to .ddw to allow others to easily import your pack.


Due to Github's filesize limits, I'll have to upload them to Dropbox, or some other file sharing service.
[Here is the link to the entire Repo](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/agffdsjybmoghi9cx52dv/ANnTvuwbevbn0YfSL0iz7SQ?rlkey=a59apqn14w25zwwqpkxpvgqvt&st=k7b89k0l&dl=0)
